# Analysis-of-United-Kingdom-Renewable-Energy.
Renewable energy production has become increasingly important in addressing climate change and  achieving sustainable development goals. In this report, I analyzed a dataset obtained from Kaggel  containing yearly data on renewable energy production in the UK from 1990 to 2020.
## Description of the Data.
The dataset consists of several columns including:
Year: The year of observation.
Energy from renewable & waste sources: Total energy production from renewable sources and waste 
in Terawatt-hours (TWh).
Total energy consumption of primary fuels and equivalents: Total energy consumption in TWh.
Fraction from renewable sources and waste: The fraction of energy production coming from 
renewable sources and waste. Various columns for specific renewable energy sources such as 
hydroelectric power, wind, wave, tidal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal aquifers, landfill gas, etc.
## Summary Statistics
I used NumPy and Pandas to compute the dataset's summary statistics, which included mean, 
standard deviation, and other key metrics. These statistics provide insight into the overall trends and 
variations in renewable energy production over time.

## Visualizations.
I created several visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the trends and patterns in 
renewable energy production. These visualizations include:
#### Line Plot - Trend of Renewable Energy Production over the Years:
The line plots reveal a significant increase in renewable energy production between 1990 and 2020, 
with wind, wave, and tidal power consumption increasing, while geothermal energy consumption 
remained steady.
Additionally, we can observe that there has been a positive shift from 1990 to 2020 in the UK's 
generation of renewable energy.

#### Density Plot - Distribution of Renewable Energy Production:
The density plot shows the distribution of energy production, highlighting dominant energy sources 
and emerging technologies. It provides a comprehensive view of the energy landscape, suggesting 
potential for diversification and sustainable development.
#### Scatter Plot - Relationship between Energy Production and Total Energy:
Renewable energy production and energy consumption trends show a positive association, with a rise 
in output and overall consumption. This indicates the importance of renewable energy sources in the 
energy system. However, other variables also influence overall consumption, highlighting the 
complexity of the transition.
#### Stacked Area Plot - Energy vs Year:
The UK's renewable energy production has evolved significantly from 1990 to 2020, with a stacked 
area plot illustrating the growth of solar energy, wind power, hydroelectric power, and other 
renewable sources. The dynamically stacked geographical segments show a more diverse and 
expanding renewable energy mix.
#### Grouped By Plot - Energy vs Years:
The grouped by plot visualization illustrates the evolution of renewable energy production in the UK 
over 30 years, showcasing the growth of hydroelectric, solar, and wind power technologies.
#### Heatmap - Correlation between Energy Sources:
Positive correlations indicate strong relationships between energy sources, while negative 
correlations suggest inverse relationships. This heatmap analysis helps policymakers optimize the 
energy mix for sustainability by analyzing the relationship between different energy sources.
Results and Interpretation
The UK is witnessing an upward trend in renewable energy production, demonstrating a shift towards 
sustainable energy sources.
## Conclusion
The UK's energy consumption has seen a significant shift towards renewable energy sources, with a 
rise in consumption from wave, tidal, and wind sources. Geothermal energy remains stable, while 
sewage gas, landfill gas, and hydroelectric power are varying. Solar energy consumption has also 
increased, indicating a significant investment in solar photovoltaic technology. This shift aligns with 
international initiatives to slow down climate change and transition to a low-carbon, sustainable 
future.
## Summary
Important conclusions reveal that energy consumption in the UK has significantly increased due to 
renewable energy sources, with wind, wave, and tidal energy consumption showing significant growth, 
indicating a commitment to sustainable energy sources.
## Recomendation
Our study leads us to suggest further funding and legislative support for the construction of 
renewable energy infrastructure, with a focus on developing technologies like solar and wind power.
